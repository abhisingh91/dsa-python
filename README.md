# dsa-python

🚀 The repo contains directories for some major topics in Data Structures and algorithms

🔍 Each directory contains solutions to some questions that I solved as a part of my learning DSA concepts

🌐 The questions are mostly from **Leetcode** which is an online platform to practice coding and algorithmic problems
